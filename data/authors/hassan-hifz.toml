bio = "Right from the age of 4, Hassan started gaming. He knows best what he is doing. Currently Hassan is Senior author at Techno Clutch. Only a tech geek knows best what components to be used for which conditions. To him, Gaming was the only way to communicate with the outer world cause he was not allowed to go outside instead of just school. He was inspired by his online friends to start his own blog to bust some myths about PC and Gadgets."
