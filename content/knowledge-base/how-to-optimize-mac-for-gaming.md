If you use [Mac](https://www.apple.com/macos) as your gaming platform, then you might be well aware of how advanced and great a gaming machine is. It not only helps you play your favorite games but also makes them enjoyable and fun by delivering proper features.

However, just like any other amazing gaming machine, it needs maintenance to stay in well-working condition. You need to make sure that you keep it functional by taking great care of its maintenance by making some useful adjustments in its software or hardware. It will keep your Mac working at the fastest speed to support all your gaming needs.

**Here are some things that you can do:**

## Free up your Hard Drive

Sometimes you have kept an abundance of documents, files, screenshots, and even the photos that cover up most of the space of the hard drive. This space makes the system busy and turns your Mac into a slow-processing machine. When your Mac gets slowed down, it negatively affects your gaming. 

To keep yourself away from this and prevent your machine from slowing down, you have to make sure that your HD has enough free space. An ideal measure is to leave almost 10% of space in your HD free all the time. This will provide your system as well the games you play, more space than they can utilize to run. 

## Close the Unnecessary Apps

If you are about to play your game on Mac, the very first thing you have to do is close some unnecessary apps. This is because all the apps, tasks, and games use up more RAM and processing power. So, make sure you close them up before starting your game. 

If you want to check how much RAM each app is using, you can use the OS X Activity Monitor. If you have a lot of windows or tabs open, there are more chances of the web browsers being notorious in this regard. Also, the sites with a bunch of YouTube windows or Flash content drains up most of the space of your RAM that is needed by the games. 

So, closing these apps might help you get the space back again, and your games can utilize that space for their operation. 

## Restarting Can Help

You can make use of multiple cleaning and app-tuning processes, but it will not free up more resources as restarting your Mac will do. Restarting your Mac at least once a week, or even more, once a month can really help. 

If you are the type of person that shuts down the system and starts it up all again daily, that’s is perfectly fine. However, if you are a person who lets the machine asleep a lot of time, make sure to restart it once in a while. It will refresh the system greatly and will help you a lot in getting the most smoother experience with your gaming. 

## Check your Hardware

Another thing which you can do to make your machine even better is to keep a check on your hardware system. While buying a brand new Mac for your gaming, make sure to first consider your gaming needs and buy the system accordingly. You can also go for the customized upgrade options which are offered by Apple and many other retailers. 

However, if you are an existing user of Mac, you can simply look out to upgrade the hardware of your system to make your gaming even better. There is one thing that you must know about your system is that graphics cards are not upgradable unless you have a Mac Pro tower. 

## Upgrade your HDD

Upgrading [HDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive) can also help you greatly in making your Mac work well to support all the games that you love to play daily. 

## Upgrade your RAM

Upgrading the [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) is a great option to go for if you want your Mac to work extremely well to support all your gaming needs. The reason for this is that RAM plays an important role in running your game more smoothly. It even allows you to play multiple types of games. So upgrading the RAM can actually help you upgrade your gaming experience. 

If you play some casual games, you might be okay with having 4GB of RAM. However, if you are desirous of doing power gaming, you might need to upgrade your RAM to 8GB or 16 GB in a total of RAM. 

If your Mac is running slow, you might upgrade its RAM, and it will make it running at great speed. So, depending upon your needs from your system, you can make any changes that you think will solve the issues accordingly. 

## Get an Advanced SSD

If you think graphics cards and processors are the only things that matter the most for gaming, they are probably wrong in this regard. Along with an upgraded processor and graphics card, advanced-level hard drives also matter a lot. 

You can think of getting a faster drive, such as [SSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive), which significantly improves the system tasks as well as the boot times. The good news is that every brand-new Mac comes with an SSD; however, for some older versions of Mac, you might not get an SSD. So, you have to upgrade your SSD to make it work best for you. 

If you think upgrading an SSD is in your budget, then it’s great, but if it’s not, you can look for a 7200RPM hard drive instead of a standard 5400 RPM model. The quicker the drive, the better will be your gaming experience. 

***Note: Before you ever order an SSD for your Mac, know that it cannot be upgraded once you get it. If you are thinking of upgrading your SSD to another level yourself, it might be an advanced task. The best thing to do at this time is to ensure that you upgrade your SSD beforehand.***
