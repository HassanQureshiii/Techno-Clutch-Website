If you are looking to figure out what operating system is most convenient and best for gaming, then this article might be of great help. There are several types of OS that you might also know, like [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/), Linux, and [mac OS](https://www.apple.com/mac/), but which one is best for playing games? This article will help you know. 

Before we first move ahead to know which OS is most suitable for gaming, let us first know in detail about all the gaming OS one by one. So, here we go!

## Windows 

![Windows](/uploads/windows.webp "Windows")

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) is undoubtedly one of the most widely used and most popular operating systems when we talk about gaming in particular. It simplifies the user interface and brings the gaming systems even closer to the public. 

After the introduction of series of incarnations, including Win95/98/NT/2000 and various other variations, a much more refined [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7) was introduced and widely used for gaming. It is only now that the new series of Microsoft Windows, [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8) and 8.2, has been introduced. 

However, the most advanced among them all is the latest introduced [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10). It comes with numerous updates and is extremely good for playing games and doing various other tasks. 

## Linux

It doesn't donate any single operating system but covers a broad range of OS that is most probably based on [open-source Linux Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel). It is an advanced operating system that offers people the most flexible and free OS. 

Prominently, the most popular of all the known OS that come based on Linux Kernel is the Google [AndroidOS](https://www.android.com/), despite the fact that they can only be used on tablets and smartphones. However, if you are thinking of some versions that you can also use on PC, then you can go for openSUSE, Debian, CentOS, Valve's [SteamOS](https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/), Ubuntu, Fedora, and much more alike. 

The great thing about these versions is that they are entirely free and are build upon various developers that suit differently to different systems. Linux is built to serve the needs of enthusiasts and professional users and also the lower hardware requirements when compared with Windows. It comes with a "user-friendly" interface, and the software’s that are compatible with it are not generally in high supply. 

## MacOS

![Mac](/uploads/mac.webp "Mac")

Initially released in 2001, it is amazingly popular worldwide in the name of its performance. The only difference between it and Windows is that it is found on MacBook computers and [Apple's iMac](https://www.apple.com/mac/). 

It is highly optimized to work with the Apple hardware only, and this makes it extremely efficient. Also, it comes with a highly secure and user-friendly operating system which is the want of almost every Apple user.

Each of these above-mentioned OS is extremely functional and is highly helpful in making the gaming experience fun, enjoyable, and highly memorable for all time. The OS can help you play your most favorite games on your desired computer, however which OS is best for gaming? It all depends upon which game you play and how much variety you want to have on your gaming list. 

Now, let us now discuss which of these OS are best for gaming that you can use to get optimal results. 

### Performance 

In terms of performance, Linux and Windows seem to be on the even ground with only slight differences from one another in terms of supporting games. Every version of Windows is known best to maintain consistent framerates, while Linux is highly efficient in providing you completely different performance through its various distributions. 

Among all the distributions of Linux, Ubuntu and SteamOS are known to be the best-performing ones. While in regard to Windows, it is highly reliable and consistent and thus provides you superior performance almost all the time.

Besides, MacOS is low-performing OS among all the three. This is mainly because of its hardware limitations that it comes with. It is designed to be non-customizable and highly compact, and this leaves very little room for GPU's and other modifications that are needed to enjoy efficient gaming. If you want to enjoy the best-ever gaming on MacOS, you will have to buy an e Thermal GPU, which is quite an investment for the users, which not everyone likes to make most of the time after buying a pricy Apple computer. 

### Game Selection

A vast majority of games are released mainly for the PC gamers who are working on Windows, as it is regarded as the most popular gaming operating system in present times. 

While on the other hand, the selection of games for MacOS and Linux is much more limited than the Windows. If you go only by steam, you will examine quite an improvement in its supported games: it supports over 4000 games at present times. Well, this is quite a less number when we compare it with Windows as it supports over 20.000 games at the moment. However, Mac comes with the ability to support almost 7000 [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) games most prominently.

## **Wrapping Up** 

Thoroughly speaking, one thing is quite obvious that Windows is regarded as one of the best and top-rated OS for gaming, at least in the present times. This is mainly because it supports the widest range of games to help users enjoy whatever game they like to play on it. Linux and MACOS cannot simply compete with Windows in this specific regard.
