This problem is also known to be caused by the in-game settings not being compatible with your computer’s specifications.

Check if the in-game FPS cap is set to unlimited or set to a higher FPS cap than your CPU can handle. Many gamers have reported that capping the FPS as per the computer system specifications can reduce CPU usage significantly.

Also, if your CPU usage is high, but your GPU usage is low, then try playing at higher graphics settings like High or Ultra. Playing at higher graphics settings pushes the usage load on your GPU from your CPU.

If none of the above settings work, try to play at low graphics settings and see if it does any help.

### Solution 4: Disable All Power Preserving Modes
