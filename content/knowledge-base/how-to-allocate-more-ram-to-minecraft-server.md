Have you ever happened to play Minecraft on your gaming device; how enjoyable it is and fun rendering. It is one of the most popular games in the gaming world and is now available for almost every gaming device, whether you use a PC, [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/), Laptop, Android, or even IOS. So, there is no issue with what platform you use to enjoy your favorite game; the only thing it provides you is increased fun and [memorable experience](https://gamingtechies.com/best-bios-setting/) (Bios guide for better gaming experience)

[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) is an amazing game that runs perfectly well on almost every platform, provided that it has enough RAM to support it. Without enough RAM, you are likely to experience crashes, stuttering, and various other similar issues, which will make the game nearly impossible for you to play. 

So. It is very important that you allocate more RAM to your Minecraft server. This allocation will do two things: either it will postpone the crashing from happening or completely prevent it from helping you play your game without any further hindrance. 

## Is Allocating RAM in Minecraft easy?

Although lesser Ram can greatly hinder your performance in the game as it is quite obvious that crashing and stuttering never let you get involved in it completely. The game becomes completely unplayable. Even though it can cause many issues but still, it is not at all difficult to allocate more RAM; it is extremely easy to do it if you follow just a few simple steps. 

Previously, allocating RAM to Minecraft was relatively difficult, but when the third-party AT Launcher got released it made the process quite easier and simpler. So, if you are facing trouble with your game mainly because of the lesser RAM support, you don’t have to worry about it. 

Here’s how you can do it! 

## Allocate more RAM to Minecraft using ATLauncher: Complete Process

This is to say that allocating RAM into Minecraft was previously difficult because it was a manual task. However, there’s now an intelligent mod that can do that for you, provided that you use it correctly. 

Following are some simple steps that you have to follow in order to allocate more RAM efficiently: 

**Install the latest version of Minecraft** Before you ever start the process of allocating more Ram, and you have to make sure that you own the latest version of Minecraft. If you don’t have its latest version, you can simply install it by visiting the site. 

### Check the Total RAM 

After that, you have made sure that your Minecraft is of the latest version; the next step is to analyze the total RAM of your computer. This will help you know how much RAM your computer currently has.

You can do this simply by going to Start, then to Settings, then System, and checking the About. You will be able to know how much RAM your computer has.

### Download and Install ATLauncher 

The next step after checking the RAM is that you download and install ATLauncher on your gaming device. This app will help you allocate the [RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory) most efficiently. 

### Navigate through ATLauncher and add RAM 

After installing the app, you have to open it up and select Settings that is present on the right-hand side. Then, in the Setting option, you have to select the Minecraft/Java tab. After doing this, you can input the amount of RAM you want to add to your gaming device. You have to add the RAM in the Maximum Memory Ram field. 

After that, you have added more RAM into the Memory Ram field; click save to save the changes you have currently made.

That’s all! You have successfully allocated more RAM into the Minecraft server, and the next time you load up the server, it’ll definitely use the specific amount of RAM that you just allocated into it.

## Allocating more RAM in a Minecraft Server

Allocating more Ram to Minecraft is simple, as you already know it. However, when you talk about allocating more RAM into Minecraft when it is hosted on a server, it is a bit different than allocating RAM through [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/). Even though it is slightly different, it is not difficult or complicated as it may seem to you. All you have to do is follow the below given simple steps to complete the process successfully. 

Here are the steps that you need to follow: 

### Open Minecraft Server Directory

The very first step that you are going to do is open up the directory of the Minecraft server; it is the folder that generally contains the Minecraft_server.exe file that is highly important as you launch the server with it. 

 If you don’t know where this directory is, you can simply search “Minecraft_server” on your Pc, and you will be lead directly to it. 

### Create a new Text Document 

After performing the first step, you have to create a new text document in the directory of the server. For this, you have to click Home, then go to New Item, and then click on the Text Document option that will be available there. This way, you can easily create a new text document for your use. 

### Allocate RAM 

If you want to allocate RAM in Minecraft server on your PC, then paste *java -Xmx####M –Xms+1####M -exe Minecraft_Server.exe -o true.*

***Note: Instead of using ####, you have to add the value for the RAM that you want to allocate to the server. For example, if you want to allocate 2Gb of RAM into the server, you will have to add 2048 instead of ####.***

### Save Changes 

After that, you have performed all the above-mentioned actions; the next step you have to take is to save the changes. For this purpose, you have to simply click on the File option, then move on to clicking on Save As and name the file server launcher. After this, you have to change the extension .txt to .bat. 

This file that you have just created will be the new Launcher for your Minecraft server. All you have to do to make it run is simply double-click it. Whenever you want to allocate a specified amount of RAM, you can use the .bat file to launch the server, and it will automatically do the task for you. 

That’s all! Now you can go back to enjoying your favorite Minecraft game on your gaming platform as you have successfully allocated specified RAM into the Minecraft server.
