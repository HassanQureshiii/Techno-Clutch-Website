Gaming is one of the most leading sports these days, and the gaming community is expanding exceptionally. With the rise in this popular sport, many new high-profile games are being introduced which demand greater hardware support from the processor.

Nevertheless, playing online games is not all about passion, but it requires some other things like focus, responsiveness, quick moves and high-speed internet. When you have these things, you're ready to go, but there is one thing that can make you lag in all of these things mentioned above: excessive GPU heating while you are gaming.

You need to take care of GPU cooling if you want to have an exclusive experience with your game.

## Why Should GPU Cooling Be Considered?

The excessive heating of your GPU can cause various issues to your gaming device that can ultimately keep you from playing your favourite online games. These issues may be:

1. Sudden shutting down of your device
2. Diminishing gaming experience
3. Louder fan noise that can irritate you
4. Premature hardware failure

All these issues are serious and can highly affect your gaming experience. If you want to enjoy the game just the way it should be enjoyed, you should consider the process on how to keep [GPU](https://gamingtechies.com/best-gpu-for-ryzen-7-2700x/) (Best GPU for Ryzen 2700x) cool while gaming.

## What is the Best Temperature for the GPU?

When you are using your computer for normal everyday gaming purposes, its average temperature ranges from 65 to 85°C.

This is the normal temperature that your GPU can handle. Any rise in temperature can cause the overheating issues that we have just discussed above. It might cause some other issues in your computer that can ultimately keep you from having the best ever and smoother experience with your game.

## The Best Way to Keep the GPU Cool

Keeping in view the issues you can face because if GPU overheats, it is necessary to know the proper way to keep it cool every time you play a game on your PC.

So here are some things that you can try to get the optimal results:

### Replace the Thermal Paste That you Have Previously Applied

![Replace the thermal paste](https://gamingtechies.com/img/replace-the-thermal-paste.webp "Replace the thermal paste")

Knowing that thermal pastes effectively reduce the issues of GPUs overheating and improve the heat transfer between heat sink, GPU and the CPU of your processor, you might have applied the [thermal paste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_paste) some time ago.

Although applying a thermal paste can help you with the issue, but it doesn't work for a longer period: overtime, the applied thermal pastes can lose their effectiveness and prevent the effective dissipation of heat and thus, in turn, cause your GPU and ultimately the processor run hot.

So, what should you do to keep your GPU cool? It's simple: you can reapply your thermal paste.

We suggest you reapply the thermal paste every 3-5 years in your GPU to improve its conductivity and prevent the issues of overheating.

Even better, you can replace your old thermal paste with some liquid metal as it is even better than the pastes in the heat transferring process.

However, you should take special care when you apply the liquid metals instead of the thermal paste because if it leaks to or spills on the other components, it could easily short-circuit the motherboard. So, instead of maintaining the temperature issues, you will unwillingly get your processor destroyed completely.

So, when you either reapply the fresh thermal paste or even replace it with the liquid metals, you will see your GPU get cooler and work more efficiently in your processor.

### Clean your GPU Roughly Every Six Months

This is very likely that the processor's parts collect a lot of dust and other materials that exhaust the vents and clog air intake. When enough dust gets accumulated in the GPU interior, it restricts the airflow and causes your GPU to overheat often.

So, to get rid of this overheating that occurs due to the accumulation of dust and other materials, you must think of cleaning your GPU twice or thrice every year.

There are some suggestions that the compressed air blows through the GPU cause this dust to go away. Nevertheless, this is not always helpful: blowing compressed air dissipates the dust and other materials further into the interior of GPU instead of extracting them out to help you get rid of them.

So, you should consider the most effective way of cleaning your GPU. All you need to do is to take it away from your processor's body and get it cleaned thoroughly. You can do it the following way:

1. Take the screwdriver and open it up apart from the processor
2. Blow the compressed air through the parts
3. Brush the linings and crevices thoroughly to extract any remains of the dust that might have gotten dissipated into the interior.

This cleaning this way can help you improve your gaming experience by keeping your GPU from overheating while you are in the round.

### Play with GPU Settings

You might enjoy playing games at higher graphics settings as it offers smoother gameplay. However, with this higher graphics card settings, you can experience greater overheating issues.

The reason for this is that the higher GPU settings put greater stress on both the graphics card as well as the processor, especially if you are playing some high profile and heavy hardware demanding games like Final Fantasy XV, Metro Exodus, Deus Ex, and Mankind Divided.

### Play your Games in a Cooler Environment

Sometimes the reason why your GPU gets overheated is that you have placed your processor in a hotter environment. Especially during the summer season, when the temperature gets higher than the normal, above room temperature, say 35 °C, your GPU gets overheated, and this greatly affects your gameplay.

So, the solution to this issue is that you play your favourite game at normal room temperature, i.e. between 10 and 35 °C. Even when your temperature rises, you can still play in an air-conditioned room to prevent your GPU from getting overly heated.

### Adjust the Fan Speed

![Adjust the fan speed](https://gamingtechies.com/img/adjust-the-fan-speed.webp "Adjust the fan speed")

The fan speed increases with the rise in temperature to keep your GPU at a relatively normal temperature. However, sometimes when you do a BIOS update, these fan configuration settings may get disturbed, and your GPU gets overheated.

So, you must keep an eye on the BIOS settings to make sure that your fan settings are properly configured. It all depends upon your gaming device settings which allow you to access the [BIOS settings](https://gamingtechies.com/best-bios-setting/) differently.

## Some Final Words

So, if you figure out the reasons for your GPU overheating, you can go for any one of the solutions given above to solve the issue. All of these above-mentioned solutions are authentic and will surely let you have a cooler and better working GPU for gaming purposes.
