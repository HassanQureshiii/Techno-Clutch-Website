  - paragraph: GPU of any computer or laptop is extremely important as it
      accelerates the graphics rendering. It is one of the most powerful parts
      of your computer or laptop that can process the widest range of data
      simultaneously. This helps your machine to get more users for your daily
      heavy-duty operations like video editing, machine learning, and various
      other gaming applications. However, to make these GPUs work efficiently,
      you must have to install some best thermal pads for the GPU that can
      extract any extra heat and make them capable of performing all the
      mentioned processes.
after_intro: >-
  Thermal pads are the most effective solid materials that extract the heat from
  the components of your device and help it remain cooler for better
  performance. These pads become softer at high temperatures and hence are
  capable of filling the imperfections in the component’s surfaces and thus
  provide them with better conduction qualities. 


  In this guide, we have included the five best thermal pads that you can use with the heatsinks of your systems to get efficient cooling for them.

          Getting your laptop over-heating every time? No worries! Get this
          thermal pad for its optima; cooling features. This thermal pad can
          make the components of your device work at the normal temperature that
          is important to maintain for any working machine. When you apply this
          thermal pad to the GPU of your laptop, you will witness amazing
          results for temperature maintenance. 


          This thermal paste is formed from silicone and an amazingly unique filler that offer a premium conductivity of almost 6.0 W/mK. You will not find this level of conductivity in any other normal thermal pad; hence this pad outperforms every other thermal pad in the market. 


          Moreover, this thermal pad is highly compressible and had low hardness: this enables the pad to work efficiently to fill the gaps, bridge uneven surfaces, and even the rough surfaces that promote the over-heating within the system. 


          The best thing about this thermal pad is that it does not contain any metallic particles. It is non-capacitive and highly electrically isolating. This makes it extremely safe to install in the components, as even it gets any contact with the electrical traces, it will not cause any damage to your system ever. 


          If you are now thinking about its application process, let us tell you it is extremely simple that even the beginner user can do it most conveniently. You can add this thermal pad yourself at your home, and whenever you feel the need to remove it, all you have to do is simply remove it back and reposition a new pad in a better way. 


          This thermal pad comes in 50 x 50 x 1.0 mm pf size with 6.0 W/mk thermal conductivity. This helps it to remove the heat from the components of your laptop up to much extent. Also, it comes with 25 Shore 00 hardness to is easy to handle and apply and also offers filling up any gaps to eliminate the over-heating.

          Then in the list, we have this thermal pad by iceberg thermal that
          comes non-electrically conductive and with a maximum thermal
          conductivity of almost 13W/mK. It is an amazing thermal pad that comes
          to fill in all the air gaps in the surfaces and to provide precisely
          and even contact between components to avoid any heat loss.  


          You can apply this thermal pad on the GPUs, VGA cards, Notebook PC Components, RAM, and SSDs to get the optimal performance all the time. It works really well in transferring the heat away from the surfaces. 


          This pad is made to last longer for years, remain flexible without ever being corroding or hardened. The best operating temperature for this thermal pad ranges from -40℃ to 200℃. So, it has strong power to withhold with varying temperature ranges under any circumstances.

          The next thermal pad on our list is this Innovation Cooling Graphite
          Thermal pad that is known best for its highly attractive features. It
          comes with a conductivity of almost 35W/m-k. This helps the pad to
          become highly efficient to reduce the heat loss that causes your
          system to overheat under heavy working conditions. 


          This thermal pad is made to contain premium durability: it comes with a dry solution that has almost zero levels of liquids. This makes the pad long-lasting and durable as it doesn’t bake or pump out like any other regular thermal compound. The addition of dry compounds makes the pad stand prominent among an extensive list of thermal pads available in the market. 


          Another thing that makes the pad unmatched is its premium temperature range, which is between -200C and 400C. So, the pad is extremely efficient to get hold of its features and efficiency in the widest range of temperature changes within your system. 


          The best and most fascinating part of the features of these pads is that they are reusable. You don’t have to spend your money on buying similar pads time and again, as these can be used on multiple builds without any performance loss. 


          This is probably the feature that is not commonly found in other thermal pads. The reason for this is that when other thermal pads are once used, they cannot be reused on any other surface as they lose effectiveness in their performance right after their first use.
    pros:
      - pro: "Durable and long-lasting "
      - pro: Powerful performance
      - pro: "Reusable "
    cons:
      - con: "Not suitable for laptops "

conclusion:
  - paragraph: The best thermal pads for GPUs are not easy to find, and you have a
      lookout for an extensive list of features to figure out whether the pad is
      suitable for your build or not. All these above-mentioned pads are amazing
      and have the powerful feature to support you with making your system
      highly functional under every circumstance.
faqs:
  - answer: Thermal pads are the solid materials that are used on the components of
      your build and ensure the maximum heat loss to leave the components cooler
      and highly functional. Keeping this in view, thermal pads can be regarded
      as the best addition-next to thermal pastes- that can help you with the
      effectiveness of your system.
    question: Do thermal pads really work?
  - answer: All great quality thermal pads come with a lifetime of almost 1 to 3
      years. However, if you are using any ordinary thermal pad, we suggest you
      replace it with the new one every 6 to 12 months.
    question: How long do thermal pads last?
  - answer: There are many thermal pads brands that offer you such thermal pads that
      you can reuse on some other build. It might be a good idea, but if you
      want to protect your system from getting any damage, we suggest that you
      never reuse the thermal pads on your system.
