  - paragraph: Ryzen processors are most commonly known as AMD CPUs that run
      powerfully on the new 1331 pin AMD
      socket [motherboards](https://technoclutch.com/best-red-and-black-motherboards/).
      These are one of the best processors that support all the heavy tasks,
      including the most illustrious games that you love to play often in a day.
      There is only one thing that can keep these processors from working
      efficiently; the overheating issue. Nevertheless, to prevent the issue
      from happening, you just have to treat your processors with the best
      thermal pastes for Ryzen processors that do their work most efficiently.
after_intro: >-
  Over-heating issues can make your processors run extremely slow that right
  irritate you in your way of enjoying your PC usage time. You apply these
  pastes on the center of the processor’s IHS before you ever install any
  cooling system in the device. This greatly reduces the overheating issues and
  turns your PC into a well-working condition once again. 


  Being so different than those of other processors like Intel and others, the paste which they need is also different. Considering this thing in mind, we have prepared a list of the best thermal compounds that suit perfectly well for all Ryzen [processors](https://technoclutch.com/best-motherboard-for-i7-4790k/), regardless of the model.

conclusion:
  - paragraph: Ryzen processors are a bit different from those of Intel, and hence
      they need different thermal compounds that could make them efficient and
      even more working. These best thermal pastes for Ryzen processors that we
      have mentioned above in our list are perfect for applying on any Ryzen
      processor that you have, and you will definitely get amazing results.
faqs:
  - answer: Many Ryzen processors come with pre-applied thermal pastes under a
      protective plastic cover, but it is mostly one-time use. So, if you want
      your processor to perform efficiently for a longer period, then you
      definitely have to reapply the paste. Thermal paste will help your
      processor work even better for an extended period.
    question: Do Ryzen processors need thermal pastes?
  - answer: There are many thermal compounds that are best to apply between the CPU
      and heatsink, among which some of the top-rated are mentioned above.
      However, being specific, consider buying a thermal paste that is
      non-electrically conductive, durable, and easy to apply.
    question: Which thermal paste is best for Ryzen processors?
  - answer: Absolutely! Removing the pre-applied thermal paste is a great idea. The
      reason for this is that removing the pre-applied thermal paste is already
      dried up and is not very much effective. If you want to increase the
      effectiveness and the life span of your CPU, then changing the paste is
      the right option.
