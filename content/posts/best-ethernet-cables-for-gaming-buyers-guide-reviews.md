buyingGuide: >-
  Knowing the best type of Ethernet cable is not enough to be confident in your
  purchase; you must look for some most common and obvious features that
  categorize an Ethernet cable as good or bad. 


  ### Category


  Ethernet cable comes in many categories: Cat6/6E, Cat5, Cat7, Cat8, and many others. Each category has its own features and level of performance, and thus the choice of it greatly depends upon the type of use you are going to do with it. 


  Despite the difference in their level and performance, each category is best in its place; however, Cat8 is considered one of the best Ethernet cables in the market that you can buy for durability and high-speed internet. Besides Cat8, Cat7 is another best choice to go for, but Cat8 is even better in its performance. 


  Online gaming requires you a solid and stable internet connection, speed, and reduced interference and noise. These things can be provided better through Cat8 cable: so it’s better to buy Cat8 Ethernet cable if you are looking for a cable solely for gaming purposes. 


  You can also get Cat7 for gaming purposes, and the best thing about this category is that you will find it a lot cheaper and faster than any other category in comparison. 


  ### Length


  The length of an Ethernet cable is another essential thing to consider when you buy it for gaming purposes. The choice for the length of the cable depends upon the place where you have placed the device: near the router or away from it. 


  If you are among the people who generally place routers near the PC so that their LAN cable can be connected to it quickly, then you need a cable of a bit shorter length. On the other hand, if you have placed your gaming device away from the router, a long-sized cable will work for you. 


  The best thing about Ethernet cable is that you can get them between the lengths of 50ft and 100ft, and also, you can get it in whatever requirements you want to have. 


  ### Speed


  This is probably the most important factor that no gamer wants to avoid in their Ethernet cables. Different types of online games need varying speeds, depending purely upon their graphics and other features. In order to get the cable for yourself, you first have to figure out which game types of games you play the most and then get the cable accordingly. 


  Nevertheless, it is always wise to get a cable that provides you the fastest speed that can handle all types of gaming responsibly and efficiently. Cat8 cables are manufactured to handle 40Gbps, while Cat7 is powerful enough to support up to 10Gbps connections. Both these cables are enough to support the gaming needs. 


  ### Range and Performance 


  The next thing that you must also not ignore is the performance and speed range that it provides to you. The best cable to choose is the one that can provide you stables speed up to the more excellent range, so you don’t have to worry about internet lagging which leads you to lose the game. 


  Cat8 cables are considered the best Ethernet cable that provides you the fastest and stable internet speed in a more extended range. 


  ### Shielding 


  Shielding of an Ethernet cable means that it is covered with a layer of grounded foil that keeps it efficient enough to prevent any electromagnetic interference. This is an important thing to consider in a cable compared to unshielded cables; shielded cables are more efficient in eliminating any interference and distortion issues. 


  This feature will significantly help you get a cable that keeps you ahead of all gamers during the game: you get an edge of winning over them with the stable, fastest, and non-lagging internet connection for a better gaming experience. 


  Ethernet cable is the only tool that can provide you with excellent internet speed and low ping needed to experience memorable game-time with friends and opponents. The importance of an Ethernet cable makes it a bit more serious about looking out for the features that we have mentioned above. If you, anyhow, ignore looking for these features, you will end up messing your purchase.
