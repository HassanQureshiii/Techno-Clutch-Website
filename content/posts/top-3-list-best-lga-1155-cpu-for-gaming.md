  If you are desirous of getting the top-notch gaming CPU that could handle all
  your heavy gaming needs, then you need to consider the following things.
  Considering these things will help you make the most authentic choice that
  will keep you satisfied for life. 


  Here are the things that you need to consider: 


  ### Frequency


  Heavy-duty gaming needs an ultra-fast CPU: the faster you refresh, the faster your gaming will be. So, it’s important that you get a CPU that has a quicker processor as compared to many others in the market. 


  ### Socket Compatibility


  The next thing you need to consider is the compatibility of your CPU with the motherboard. The compatibility of both motherboard and CPU ensures premium performance. In this case, you need to make sure that you buy a Cpu that is highly compatible with your motherboard that has LGA 1155 socket. 


  ### Cache


  It is referred to same as the memory of the processor; however, it is used for short-term storage. It makes everything easy to grab and allows the machine to recover when Cache crashes. 


  Thus when buying a CPU, buy the one with a bigger Cache. This is because the bigger the Cache of the CPU is, the more data can be stored for a faster recovery. This is an important thing to keep in mind while buying a CPU, especially for gaming purposes. 


  ### Thermal Scheme Power


  This is referred to as the measure of total heat the processor gives off. It is highly important to consider because it affects the cooling efficiency of the CPU: Overheating can greatly affect the performance of your CPU. 


  ***Note: To keep your CPU functioning at high speed and greater efficiency, if it does not come with a cooling system, then you should install one.***

          The fact that this processor is made exclusively to support high-end
          games, it comes with ultra-powerful features and functionality. The
          addition of these features is what makes the processor suitable for
          gaming and other heavy-duty tasks that most other CPUs cannot support.
          Games like CS: GO, Valorant, War Zone, and many others can be smoothly
          run onto this CPU. 


          Firstly, this is a 3.50 GHz Intel Core i7-3770K Processor that comes with eight threads and four cores. The reason the cores and threads are added to any CPU is to improve its functionality and performance. Cores are actual hardware components, whereas the virtual component of the processor is threading: both combine to perform various functions within the processor. 


          Threads improve computational speed-up and throughput. While on the other hand, threads perform numerous operating processors through the CU. Hence, the addition is extremely important. 


          So, when we talk about this CPU, we see the total numbers of cores and threads count 4 and 8, respectively. This means the CPU is highly efficient in its performance, supports all kinds of online games that you are addicted to playing. 


          Secondly, the CPU comes with an 8 MB L3 shared Cache that further increases the performance efficiency to support multiple high-end games and tasks. The Cache in a CPU is referred to as a small amount of memory that is within the CPU that holds the instructions temporarily and processes the data using extremely lesser space. 


          The addition of 8 MB L3 shared Cache in this CPU makes it extraordinary in its functions and performance. So, when you buy it to support your heavy-duty games, rest assured that you will get premium results. 


          Then, the CPU also contains a two-memory channel that collectively supports a maximum of up to 32GB of memory. With this increased memory, your processor gets super-fast with great internal space to store up many of your favorite things: offline games and other heavy apps. 


          All these features combine to make this CPU the best-ever product to buy, especially the one considering for LGA 1155 socket. The socket itself is known to be powerful enough to support the functions of the CPU within the system and thus makes it capable of supporting all types of modern gaming. After all, this is what you are looking for here.

          Foremost, this processor comes with 3.4 GHz of clock speed, meaning that the processor is able to showcase ultra-fast speed and performance every time. Clock speed is referred to as the rate at with the processor executes a certain task; thus, the greater the clock speed, the better a processor at processing the task. 


          Then, this processor comes along with a maximum Turbo Frequency of 3.9 GHz. Turbo Boost Technology is an advanced addition within a processor that ensures to run the processor core at a faster speed than the marked frequency. The best thing about this technology is that it does everything automatically. Thus, we say this processor has a maximum of 3.9 GHz Turbo Frequency, and this means the processor has the ability to run at an even faster speed and showcase increased performance of both its multithread and single-thread applications. 


          Next comes Cache: this processor has about 8 MB of total Cache. This ensures to keep the processor working at a faster speed while simultaneously helping it to recover a large amount of data within seconds. This is probably the thing you must not ignore in your CPU as it makes it capable of handling all your heavy games and applications without ever letting it get slowed down in a fraction of seconds. 


          Moreover, the maximum memory bandwidth of this processor is 225.6 GB/s. Now, what uses it can be to you? Well! It is the measure of the rate at which the processor reads and stores the data into a semiconductor memory. This means, the greater the CPUs memory bandwidth, the faster its speed is for processing various functions. 


          This processor has everything any hard-core gamer would want to have in their gaming partner. Increased speed, powerful data processing feature, great memory, budget price, and an extraordinary look: this makes a gamer happy with both purchase and the use of the unit.
