  Ryzen 5 3600 is an awesome processor that supports all your heavy-duty games
  and heavier tasks, so pairing it with the best compatible motherboard is
  extremely important. The following things will help you know which motherboard
  suits most to your Processor. 


  ### Socket Form 


  This is probably the first thing that you need to look out for in a motherboard. Compatibility for the formed socket is necessary to look for in a motherboard as it helps the components to be in touch with one another and serve better communication through the system. 


  Generally, the AM4 socket is thought to be most compatible with almost all the motherboards; however, to date, B450 and X470 support all the 5000 series processors. So, when you are looking for a compatible socket for your Ryzen 5 3600, make sure you buy any one of these. This will help you enjoy the features of your mobo to their fullest. 


  ### Memory Speed 


  The next thing that you also should not ignore is the motherboard's support for memory speed. The need for memory speed support entirely depends upon the purpose you use your PC for, whether for gaming or other purposes? 


  If you are a hard-core gamer and love to play heavy-duty online games most of the time in a day, then buying a motherboard that can support varying high frequencies at any instance of time is a must.


  For example, the motherboards supporting 144Hz are just perfect for supporting your gaming needs but, if you ever need any extra FPS and you manage to get them through an overclocked RAM, your motherboard must also be capable of reaching up those top frequencies. 


  So, before buying a mobo for your use, ensure beforehand the purpose of your use and your need for some extra FPS, and then buy a unit that completely aligns with your requirements. 


  ### VRM 


  Then come VRMs: they are necessary to look out for in a motherboard as they are responsible for lowering down the voltage for the CPU by converting the power that is required by the Processor. These are important components within the motherboards as they relate directly to stability and overclocking. 


  The higher the number of VRM phases, the better the voltage conversion division is among the power phases. These are powerfully attractive advantages in a motherboard for a new user and hence are not to be neglected anyways. 


  ### Warranty 


  The last thing that you need to look for in a motherboard is the warranty that provides you with a solid backup plan to look to when you face any trouble with the unit. It is an extremely important thing to consider as it shows the manufacturing quality and confidence in the overall device. 


  The reason looking out for a warranty serves as an important thing when buying a motherboard is that the motherboards are a complex assembly of small electronic parts that are put together to make the PC's functionality possible and even powerful. Hence, it is extremely important for a person to ensure that each of the components of the motherboard works well and to its full potential: the warranty feature helps you make sure of that.
