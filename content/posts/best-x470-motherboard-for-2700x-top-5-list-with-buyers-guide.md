  Only knowing the best motherboards that go perfectly well with your 2700x is
  not enough; you still must know some important things and features that are
  necessary to look for in each Motherboard, as they greatly influence its
  performance. 


  This is because, when you keep these things in view, there are lesser chances of you making a wrong choice for the Motherboard, and you will be satisfied for a longer period with the best features that your Motherboard will provide. 


  Here are some things that you should look for in a motherboard while you are buying it for your Ryzen 7 2700x. 


  ### Socket


  The very first thing that we suggest you look for in a processor’s socket. With this socket, your processor will be able to be compatible with the Motherboard you have just bought. If you are vigilant enough in making a choice on the base of the socket, we are sure that your Motherboard will provide you with an exceptionally great performance throughout the course of its life. 


  So, how to know the socket type? Well! There are many sockets available in the market for the past many years, but only three sockets are highly applicable to the processors that are trending now, including your 2700x. These sockets include PGA, LGA, and BGA sockets. 


  There is one thing you should keep in mind that the Intel processors come supporting only the LGA sockets. However, on the other hand, BGA and PGA support the AMD processor. You don’t have to worry about getting these sockets separately for your Motherboard, as these come available as a default set-up in a motherboard. 


  So, what you have to do is simply check which socket is present in the Motherboard a default set-up and whether it will support your processor or not, and then make a wise decision.


  ### Chipset 


  Before looking out for the best Motherboard for your processor, you first have to figure out the chipset option available in your CPU. The chipset option will greatly determine the choice of your Motherboard. 


  Also, you need to keep in mind the purpose of your PC usage. If you are using your PC for high-end purposes, then we suggest you go for the Intel or AMD Motherboard as they make an ideal choice for it. 


  **Note:** In Intel, you can consider going for the high-end chipset that is most commonly known as Core X., while for AMD, you can choose to go for the AMD chips. So, you will have to decide between one of them: X399 for AMD and X299 for Intel.* 


  Besides, if you know that you are using your computer for average purposes like everyday tasks, you can then choose any chipset from X370 or X470 from AMD and Z370 from Intel. In this case, you can install an additional graphic cat and effectively use it for numerous smaller numbers of multi-drives that will not load your Ryzen processor much. 


  Nevertheless, X570 and X470 chipset motherboard are considered best for 2700x as it provides professional functions and features. You will watch it having access to the PCI-E 4.0 bandwidth with the NVMe storage for your whole system. 


  Moreover, it provides the super-speed and makes the quality of the functions more upgraded and admirable. 


  ### Form Factors


  The last thing that you have to look for is the form factor. It is one of those very basic things that you actually need to look for in a motherboard. The form factor includes the general shape, size of the processor, and also all its specifications. Not only this, but they include the elements to help you place the exact power supply case into your processor. 


  For your Ryzen-7 2700x, the ATX becomes the best choice. This is because this form factor includes the standard location for your mouse, I/O ports, keyboard, and also video connectors. 


  This has become the most popular among a wide number of the gaming community who want their processor to be working powerfully to support their heavy-end games. 


  However, the most obvious reason for which this has become most popular is that you can effectively change its specifications later on, such as cases and power supply. So, there is zero interaction between the Motherboard and the drive bays. Also, its I/O port connectors are strongly held in the Motherboard. 


  That’s how it has become the most powerful, popular, and best partner for the Ryzen 2700x.
