      it really provide the user with its performance. Not only is this gaming
      system better than using a PC because of the reason that you can move
      around the whole experience using a simple controller, but also because it
      is easy to maintain: you get quick software updates and other gameplay
      options."

  This is why using a thermal paste extremely important when it comes to
  enhancing the performance efficiency of PS4. It helps in dissipating the heat
  out from the unit and never lets the accumulated heat damage the system. 


  All thermal pastes mentioned as “good” are not good in the real sense, you have to try it to check their efficiency. Nevertheless, don’t worry, you don’t have to waste your money on buying and trying the products first before finalizing it to use for long term as we have made a list of 5 best thermal paste that is tried and tested by us and following are the honest reviews for each of them.

  There are many brands for the thermal pastes in the market that promise you
  impressive performance but are unable to do so. All of the pastes are so
  promising and appealing that you can see hardly any apparent difference in
  them, but this is not the case: not every paste is the same and the fact that
  differentiates them from one another is the quality of manufacturing, and the
  performance. 


  Nevertheless, there is no specific way of knowing the quality of manufacturing and performance without ever buying them and using them in person: which might not be possible for you every time. 


  Don’t worry you don’t need to waste your money buying the product first and then analyze which thermal pastes suit you best, as we have compiled a list of parameters that you must compare the paste against to figure out whether it is best for you to buy or not. 


  ### Carbon Micro-particles 


  A good thermal paste is one that is thermally conductive and electrically insulating, which is mostly provided by the carbon micro-particles. These micro-particles are composed of silicones, acrylates, urethanes, epoxies, hot-melt adhesives, and solvent-based systems. These carbon micro-particles are made to have excellent thermal conductivity and ensure to dissipate any extra heat from the system efficiently and quickly. 


  So, when it comes to buying a quality thermal paste, you must consider buying a thermal paste that comes manufactured with carbon micro-particles. This is because these particles make the paste capable of performing its function effectively and don’t let you regret the choice you have made over buying it. 


  ### Silver Particles 


  This is another most important factor to consider in a thermal paste when you make up your mind about buying it. The paste that is filled with unique high-density micronized silver, showcase excellent performance and perfectly high thermal conductivity. You can also go considering a paste that comes with aluminum filling: both of them are highly effective in transferring heat between the PS4 components. 


  If you get to buy any such kind of thermal paste for your PS4, it is a plus and you will a drastic improvement in the performance of the PS4. 


  ### Ease of Application/Replacement 


  Next, you have to consider the fact that whether the paste you are buying is an easy-to-apply and replace product or not. 


  Thermal paste should be an easy-to-apply, and when you feel the need of replacing it, it should be able to separate from the surface of the semiconductor device without leaving any residues. 


  Some thermal interface materials and high-temperature working components create issues when you try to separate them from filler matrix or polymer. So, when you are considering buying a thermal paste, you must lookout for the one which ensures to address the loss of polymeric material during high-temperature separation. 


  Getting this type of thermal paste is also important as it improves the wettability and reduces the thermal resistance that might be harmful to the system under demand. 


  ### Price 


  Price is another most important factor that you mustn’t ignore while buying a thermal paste for your PS4. If you are thinking about saving some dollars risking the performance and life of your PS4 processor, then we must say, you are going on the wrong side. However, this also doesn’t mean that it has to be too expensive for the features. 


  A powerful and quality thermal paste is the one that you get at prices between $20 and $30. Any paste worth more or less than the price is either too cheap or too expensive for the performance they have to deliver. 


  So, these were some important factors that you must consider while buying a thermal paste to enhance the performance of your PS4. If you ignore to consider these factors, there are high chances that you will end up wasting your money on buying a product that is not worth considering to apply on the gaming device.
