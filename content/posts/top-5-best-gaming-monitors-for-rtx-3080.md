buyingGuideHead: Quick Shopping Tips for Buying the Best Monitor for RTX 3080
buyingGuide: >-
  Do you like the new RTX 3080? Chances are you will be upgrading pretty soon if
  you haven't already. But you need a suitable monitor to unleash the true
  performance of this beast of a GPU. So what's wrong with your current monitor?
  Everything! The graphics of the gaming industry have greatly changed,
  especially in the last few years. With major game titles coming up in 2022,
  everyone needs to reevaluate their gaming system. Older monitors can only have
  a limited refresh rate, lower resolution, and an ineffective pixel density. 


  Another great thing about 2022 is the new Windows upgrade schedules for the mid-spring of the next year. This upgrade favors the gaming community. It will include a built-in HDR function to enhance the graphics of all Windows games. Moreover, the new update will also allow android games to run on your system. So, it's about time you upgrade your gaming rig for the future. Here are a few factors that you should keep in mind when choosing a monitor for RTX 3080:


  ### Refresh Rate


  What's the point of a higher game FPS if your monitor is incapable. According to GameTech, the new RTX 3080 can play Valorent with up to 200+ frames per second. Without a proper monitor refresh rate, all this capability becomes useless. Therefore, you need a monitor with a 120-240Hz refresh rate. It means that the display matches your current framerate per second and displays what's happening in the game. Moreover, a higher refresh rate takes away most game lags due to the low refresh rate. However, the ping and hardware optimization effect is still in place. 


  All the products in this list have a suitable refresh rate for CALL OF DUTY, Valorent, and PUBG. So, you will get an optimized gaming experience regardless of which product you choose. 


  ### **Response Time**


  The response time is another deciding factor for online shooter games. Do you ever feel like the cursor is not moving according to your mouse actions? This slight delay can majorly impact your gameplay experience. It is usually because most gaming mouses have a higher DPI, but the monitor's response time doesn't match such speed. As a result, your aim seems laggy no matter how much you increase or decrease the DPI. Moreover, the response time can also mess up your hours of video editing. The monitor doesn't respond to your editing effects like hue, vignette, and motion blur in time, and you end up placing the effect in the wrong frame. 


  Therefore, you need a monitor with at least 0.8-1ms response time. The quick response ensures that the display is available in real-time and not with a few ms delay. Quick response time will provide you with an unmatchable speed in the game as long as you can keep up with the refresh. Otherwise, you need some advice and hours of training to game effectively and eliminate all the enemies. 


  ### Resolution


  Did you know? The RTX 3080 can play most games like Assassin's creed Valhalla, GTA V Online, and Call of duty vanguard at 4K resolution. So, why not utilize such performance by playing the way it's meant to be played. Most typical gaming monitors only have 1080P or 2K resolution, which is ineffective for viewing the highest quality graphics. So, you need a gaming monitor that displays accurate colors and true pixels as rendered by the GPU. Having at least a 2K or 4K resolution monitor is a must for every RTX 3080 owner out there.


  4K has become so normal that even youtube has several videos in 4K. So, whether you want a monitor for gaming, working, or watching movies, 4K is a must-have for you. It would help to check the product specifications and physically test the hardware before actually purchasing a monitor for RTX 3080. 


  ### Adaptation


  All the graphics cards are either manufactured by Nvidia or AMD. Both the brands have their pros and cons; I won't be talking about that for now. Nvidia cards are optimized for the G-Sync adaptation. It provides a higher refresh rate, better performance and unlocks the Optimus technology of modern Nvidia GPUs. Similarly, AMD cards are optimized for the FreeSync physical module. It unlocks several premium features of the card and provides the advertised performance without overheating or overclocking. 


  So, it would be best to choose the monitor according to your GPU. Most of the products in this list have both G-Sync and FreeSync adaptation modules. So, you can choose any product from above, and I assure you that your graphics card will work without any problems. For other users, I recommend that you check the product specifications and choose according to your gaming setup and experience the market's best.

          When it comes to quality gaming, you are allowed to get picky. The
          best gaming experience is only possible if the monitor matches your
          hardware. If you are in the market for the best option at hand, LG
          34GP83A-B is second to none.


          We all know the achievements of LG in terms of screen size and PPI. LG makes their screens, and LG phone screens speak for themselves.

For example, you can connect your gaming pc to one HDMI port and the TV box to the other.

          Gaming systems have to beat them all both visually and
          performance-wise. Samsung G7 is the latest gaming monitor that focuses
          on fast-paced shooter games. Therefore, if you want an Esports-like
          gaming experience, this product is the best one for you.


          Most Shooter gamers complain that they die before even spotting the enemy. It is usually because the competitor probably has a higher refresh rate than yours—otherwise, it's all about ping, response time, and your mouse DPI. Having a powerful gaming monitor like the Samsung G7 gives you the upper hand over others. Its 240Hz refresh rate, along with the fastest 1ms response time, is the highest in the whole market.


          The G-sync + FreeSync compatibility bends the odds in your way. G-sync is the signature technology for Nvidia graphic cards. Similarly, FreeSync is suitable for AMD GPUs. Having both these technologies in the monitor makes it universally compatible with your current GPU and future upgrades. Secondly, the high 109 PPi provides a higher pixel density and thus a richer display. The OLED experience is suitable for power-saving and separating the colored parts of the image from the dark ones.


          All in all, if your Samsung G7 provides more than enough performance for shooter games. Another benefit of choosing the Samsung G7 monitor is its curved display. We all are familiar with the amazing edge technology in Samsung phones. They took it to the next level by providing a high-quality curved display. It provides a higher field of view. Increased view means you can keep your eye out for the enemy much effectively. In short, every aspect of the Samsung G7 favors multiplayer FPS games. However, if you want better graphics rather than a quick response time, this device is not the one for you.
