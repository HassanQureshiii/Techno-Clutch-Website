          MSI is known to produce some of the world's top-notch gaming
          accessories in the world. Therefore, every gaming build includes at
          least one MSI product unless you are a brand enthusiast. People are
          often confused between Asus and MSI accessories because both provide
          premium quality products. MSI MEG X570 GODLIKE is the latest flagship
          motherboard that beats several competitors. So, if you are into
          overclocking and system tweaking, this product is a must-have for you.


          AMD Ryzen 7 2700x provides a very similar performance to the Intel i7 8700K processors. However, the price difference between the two processors is high. So, if you want to squeeze every bit of performance from your budget, I'd suggest the Ryzen processor. Though Ryzen 7 comes with its own cooler, you still need to use other methods to keep the temperatures under control. MSI GODLIKE motherboards provide an effective thermal management system that ensures perfect ventilation throughout the board. The X570 chipset truly understands the cooling that your processor requires. For instance, the CPU, GPU, and M2 drives are covered with a special heatsink guard. The guard conducts a maximum amount of heat from the parts to the coolers. Moreover, the temperature is slightly reduced as the heat travels through the extended heat sink pipes in the board. So, if you consider overheating to be a big problem, this motherboard has no shortage of optimum coolers.


          Similarly, a gaming PC means that you will be playing a lot of face-paced multiplayer shooters like COD and Valorant. Several users face ping drop issues even if they have a stable internet connection. It is usually due to a less powerful Wi-Fi or Lan card. Fortunately, this motherboard comes with the world's most efficient Wi-Fi module. The 9th gen Intel processors can't even dream of such speed optimization and ping stability with their chips. Secondly, the simultaneous connection with the 2.5 Lan can double your Internet speed and enhance your gaming experience.


          The system's benchmark scores are greatly affected by the Ram speed. For instance, a slight upgrade in the Ram can increase the benchmarking scores by at least 100 points. Luckily, MSI GODLIKE motherboards support up to 2666MHz Rams in dual channels. The board is also optimized for safe overclocking and tweaking. You have the CMOS reset button in case you mess up the BIOS. Similarly, you have enough input ports for attaching your Mouse, Keyboard, Joysticks, Sound systems, display, and other useful equipment to the PC.

          People prefer AMD products for their reliable performance at an
          affordable price. However, the cheaper components often require an
          expensive motherboard. So, the budget that you save on hardware is
          often spent on buying a suitable motherboard. Fortunately, Asus has
          stepped up to provide the most affordable motherboard for AM4
          processors. So, if you are on a tight budget, the Asus TUF gaming
          motherboard is best for you.


          Asus TUF accessories provide military-grade protection combined with the signature Asus performance. However, this product range usually costs more than others and still the price is well-justified. Fortunately, this year Asus changed the trend, and their budget motherboard is from the TUF family. The good news is that Asus didn't cut off any of the performance and features from this board. It provides almost similar functions to the other Asus premium motherboards but with an acceptable price tag. For instance, this board supports up to 4400MHz 64GB gaming Rams in dual channels. This Ram upgrade will add at least 10-FPS to your games without increasing the load on GPU and CPU.


          The problem with previous TUF motherboards was poor heat management. Users often reported system overheating issues even when just using content creation software. Luckily, this year's motherboard has solved this issue with the improved heatsinks integrated directly inside the TUF guards. But if you plan to overclock your gaming system, I'd suggest that you avoid using this board. Otherwise, the heat management is strong enough for long hours of hardcore gaming.


          Similarly, the TUF guard protects all vital system components from fall damage. Even the 6x SATA drives are housed inside the thermal guard to increase the lifespan and prevent data corruption over time. You get as many input ports as any other motherboard from the market. The board has HDMI 1. 0 & 2.0 ports for connecting new and older monitors. You can also create a multi-screen system for better visuals and increase the depth of field of all games.


          You might want to further push the system by adding dual-GPUs to the system. However, you can only use AMD Crossfire cards for multi-GPU support.
