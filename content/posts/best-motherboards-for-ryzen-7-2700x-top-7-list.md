  - paragraph: There is a never-ending debate between Intel and AMD processors. Each
      year, both the brands compete head-on to produce the most powerful
      processor in the world. Previously, Intel ruled the gaming market with its
      11th generation processors. However, times have changed, and AMD has been
      crowned the best gaming processor for the past 3-years. The 2nd and 3rd
      generation Ryzen processors are far more superior than their Intel
      counterparts and fairly priced.

  In this regard, Ryzen 7 2700x is one of the most powerful 2nd generation
  gaming processors. It outperforms several 8th generation Intel processors and
  just stands behind the expensive i7 8700k. The game developers understand the
  potential of 2nd gen Ryzen processors. The multicore processing speed of this
  processor provides unmatched performance. So, it is equally suitable for both
  gamers and content creators.


   As a matter of fact, all the new games like Assassin’s creed Valhalla and Call of Duty Vanguard are optimized for the Ryzen 7 processors. You can get eight cores and up to 16 threads with this second-gen Ryzen processor. Similarly, its base clock is 3.7GHz, and the boost clocks in at a whopping 4.3GHz.  Such processing power is more than enough to play the latest games for the next 1-2 years.
