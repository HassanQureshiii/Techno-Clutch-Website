buyingGuideHead: How to find a suitable Graphics Card for your pc
buyingGuide: >-
  There are several variables to consider when selecting the best video card for
  you. Dimensions, resolution, clock speed.


  If you're just getting started and these words aren't completely obvious to you, here are some explanations and pointers to keep in mind while choosing the ideal graphics card for your requirements. It should be noted that it is strongly advised to invest in the mid/high range for stream gaming.


  ### Screen resolution


  An essential consideration for a PC gamer is what resolution the video card is best suited for. Yes, the higher the number of graphic pixels on a screen, the more power it will demand from its GPU. 


  If you have a 1080p screen, designing a PC needs a delicate balance to avoid bottlenecks and power outages.


  Even low-end GPUs can now display some games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels (or more simply in 4K). 


  However, certain games in beta or demanding a lot of power (PUBG) will be poorly handled by a low-end graphics card. In particular, the video card calculates the locations, geometry, and lighting and restoring the image to the screen in real-time.


  Higher resolution and accuracy will necessitate more processing power from the graphics card.


  Of course, depending on your video card, it will be feasible or even suggested to lower the degree of detail in the visuals to get better performance and a good number of FPS. 


  It is worth noting that today's most advanced graphics cards are designed for 4K resolution and occasionally deliver extremely high Frame Rates.


  ### Graphics engine clock frequency/speed


  The clock speed refers to the rate at which the CPU executes graphics requests given by the processor. By limiting yourself to graphics cards from the same family, the number of Mhz will correlate to the speed of your video card. 


  Be aware that just because a graphics card has the highest clock speed on the market does not guarantee it is the quickest. No way, because everything is dependent on the quality of its architecture. Higher-frequency video cards can occasionally be slower. So, don't be afraid to educate yourself and look at tests and comparators.


  The boost clock is the pace at which the graphics processor may momentarily accelerate when a large load arrives unexpectedly. It's similar to Turbo Boost for CPUs. Of course, it will only work as long as the temperature circumstances permit!


  ### The video memory of the graphics card


  You should be aware that the video card's RAM can hold all of the fundamental graphical data of a video game. Because it is directly built into the graphics card, it provides ultra-fast data access and enables improved gaming performance. There is no need to access the PC's total RAM!


  As a result, video memory provides considerably quicker bandwidth, which is undoubtedly impressive and necessary for video games. 


  So, don't be confused: the speed of the bandwidth, not the number of GB of RAM accessible on the graphics card, essentially enhances the graphics card's performance. However, to make the most of this incredible bandwidth, we will want a room!


  Indeed, depending on the appetite of your game and the resolution of your screen, a few Giga will be required to experience maximum performance across the board. 


  This allows your graphics card to retrieve all of the graphical data required to execute the game at its highest settings. 


  It is worth noting that currently, a card designed for 1920 x 1080 pixel (1080p) games would often contain 4 GB or 6 GB of RAM. Cards for playing on 2560 x 1440 (1440p) or 3840 x 2160 (2160p or 4K) screens will often have 8 GB or more.


  ### Freesync and G-sync graphics cards


  AMD's Freesync and Nvidia's G-sync are examples of "adaptive sync" technology. The screen will display a refresh rate that will adjust based on the graphics card's output capabilities. 


  Without this technique, the frame rate might cause various artifacts, shifts, or even jerks on the visual level. 


  Essentially, these technologies let the monitor display the image only when the graphics card has given all of the resources required to display it in its entirety.


  If your best gaming monitor supports any of these two technologies, it can only be a significant plus in terms of the graphical quality of its video games. But be careful: you must use a graphics card that supports the same technology as the screen, either G-sync or Freesync.


  Each graphics card will consume a different amount of power. This might be a factor to consider if you have a limited budget.

          Nvidia's Nvidia's new RTX 3060 Ti is an unexpected entry to the company's range of RTX 3000 Line-up. It will provide greater performance than the prior, and the RTX 3060 Ti will be capable of 4K gaming if you're prepared to lower the settings.


          The card's size and form are similar to an RTX 3070 coupled with a conventional dual-fan configuration. The two fans operate in tandem to keep the card cool.


          In addition, the 3060 Ti has a single HDMI connector and three Display ports. Nvidia has removed the USB-C port present in the RTX 2000 series. The power needs for Nvidia's RTX 3000 series cards have all been increased, although the RTX 3060 Ti is milder. Nvidia recommends a 600W power supply for the RTX 3060 Ti, consuming up to 200 watts.


          DLSS has constantly impressed us throughout our testing of the RTX 3060 Ti. You can choose between quality and reliability modes for DLSS in a broad range of games. Nvidia's image analysis technology will effectively make the game at a lower resolution and then upscale the image to make it look realistic.


          If you want to create an affordable 2k gaming PC, the RTX 3060 Ti is a must-have. It offers great 2k performance, support for ray tracing, Nvidia's DLSS innovation, and a variety of RTX features aimed at professionals.

          Instead of the previously utilized very loud blower-style cooling system, the 6800 XT now uses axial cooling. This means that the three fans on the card's bottom suck in air to cool the card, which is then discharged out the side into the rest of your PC Casing.


          There's a huge red Radeon symbol on the side, which also lights red when plugged in.


          For the 6800 XT, AMD recommends a 750W power supply. However, because AMD's card consumes up to 300 watts, it helps to reduce environmental and power cost implications.


          We've also found that the 6800 XT now operates at about 77 degrees Celsius, which is a significant improvement.


          The RX 6800XT is designed for 4K gaming systems, but it is also cheap for most typical gamers. This GPU is just marginally less expensive than the RTX 3080, which makes it an appealing option is performed. 


          But, more crucially, AMD finally introduced what it had lacked compared to Nvidia: ray tracing. It is currently included with the 6000s series of graphics cards and other valuable capabilities such as variable-rate shading, intelligent access memory, and supersampling.


          Furthermore, the RX 6800 XT includes Radeon Boost, a software function that enhances in-game performance when in motion by dynamically lowering render resolution. When there is no more movement, the resolution scales back up without your knowledge. 


          In certain games, this functionality can result in considerable frame rate increases. However, bear in mind that not all games support this feature, so you should frequently check the list for driver updates.


          Overall, the RX 6800 XT is a decent 4K-capable alternative to the RTX 3080, and it will benefit from working alongside the Ryzen 9 5900X thanks to AMD's hardware improvements.

          Nvidia RTX 2070 Super is suitable for 2k gaming and rendering for people without a large budget for 4K setups or high-end workstations.


          What distinguishes the RTX 2070 Super from other GPUs is that it includes the same software enhancements as the RTX 3000s series. 


          In other words, we can use ray tracing, adaptive shading, and supersampling without needing to upgrade to next-generation GPUs. With the release of the RTX 3070, the 2070 Super begins to feel out of place and superfluous. 


          The two are virtually the same in price, and because the RTX 3070 is superior, there isn't much need to choose 2070 over it. With that in mind, this GPU may be worth purchasing soon if Nvidia lowers the price.


          While the RTX 2060 Super demonstrated to be a more powerful card and finally a befitting step up over the RTX 2060 for the money, the RTX 2070 Super aims to expel the current RTX 2070 completely they sit at the same base price.


          Moreover, you get substantially more results for the same money, with even bigger advances once you start talking ray-tracing and DLSS. In conclusion, the RTX 2070 Super is a fantastic investment, and much better if you want to dabble in DLSS and ray-tracing.

          The RTX 3070's performance and pricing place it at the ideal tipping point for 1440p gaming. The great majority of PC gamers continue to use 1080p screens, and the RTX 3070 provides an upgrade route to 1440p without the high expense of an RTX 3080 and the additional power drain.


          Fundamentally, the GeForce RTX 3070 will be comparable to the RTX 3080 and 3090... Except that it doesn't, because changes to core counts and memory speed may all have a substantial influence on performance. It features more cores than the previous model but less memory and bandwidth.


          This is one cheap beast, with double the amount of stream processors as its predecessor, the RTX 2070. Furthermore, like the RTX 3080, it supports PCI Express 4.0, as does the Ryzen 9 5900X, making it a tremendous future-proof GPU.


          In terms of features, the RTX 3070 is on par with its larger sibling, the 3080. As a result, you'll be able to experience ray tracing, enhanced super sampling, and RTX I/O technologies.


          In general, the RTX 3070 runs admirably, even in 4K configurations; however, keep in mind that some games may not run at 60 frames per second on highly high settings. However, given that it is as strong as the RTX 2080 TI for half the price, it is well worth purchasing.

          The GPU is stronger than the RTX 3080 but slightly slower than the 3090 founders edition, yet it sits precisely between the two and offers outstanding overall performance. If you desire anything excellent, this is the route to take.


          The RTX 3080 Ti has the same weight and size as the original RTX 3080. The RTX 3080 Ti has two fans, one on the front and one on the back, much like the RTX 3080.


          The fan arrangement draws air from the front of the card and out from the back and blasting hot air through the top of your case.


          But, remarkably, Nvidia could get so close in thermals, especially because it reduced the cooler back down to a dual-slot design.


          The RTX 3080 Ti, like the rest of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series, is built on the Nvidia Amp technology and delivers the same advancements as the rest of the range.


          If you're putting together a gaming PC and want a card that will blow you away, this is it. For example, you will get outstanding 4K performance without a glitch; this GPU delivers and does a wonderful job at it. So, to begin with, you won't have to be too concerned.


          You'll also have access to Nvidia's whole software package functions, which isn't only for gaming. We're still smitten with Nvidia Broadcasting, purportedly meant for streamers and video makers, but we find it very helpful in everyday life.


          Finally, the RTX 3080Ti comes with a set of tools that may be used for purposes other than gaming. With the increased number of streamers, there is a need for improved streaming technology and quality, and this GPU is here to provide that with its Nvidia Broadcast function. 


          This software enhances the stream's quality by using AI to eliminate background noise and replace your natural background with the game's background.


          In conlusion, you can't go wrong with the RTX 3080 for HD or 4K gaming, and the capabilities it has are also handy for workstations.

          The RTX 3090 is a massive GPU; this card is physically enormous, with an equally big heatsink, and is designed for 4K and 8K gaming and high 3D rendering performance for workstations that are in mind when choosing your case and motherboard.


          While the base and boost clock frequencies are virtually comparable to the RTX 3080, this GPU has 24 GB of GDDR6X memory on a 384-bit bus and over 10,500 CUDA cores.


          This is a considerable boost, but the card is quite expensive, but nowhere like the previous RTX Titan. This GPU is aimed at professional 3D modelers and game enthusiasts with significant wallets. 


          The RTX 3090 is certainly overkilled for most gamers, while the RTX 3080 is more than adequate. The price difference may not always warrant the additional performance increase.


          While the RTX 3090 is a beast in terms of physical specifications, its usefulness, like the whole 3000 series, is improved by software. It has all the bells and whistles, including ray tracing, RTX I/O, and supersampling. 


          On the flip side, this means we'll have to speak about how much electricity it needs to run. According to Nvidia, a 750W power supply is sufficient, although this is highly questionable. 


          If we operate the 3090 to its full potential, it will use slightly more than 350W on its own. A strong CPU and other gadgets would undoubtedly push a 750W power supply to its maximum. So, if you're interested in this card, a 900 to 1000W power supply would be your best choice.


          In essence, the RTX 3090 is designed for fans rather than regular gamers. Even if you're interested in 8K gaming, bear in mind that there aren't many 8k displays available right now.

          This new NITRO+ card design is identical to previous versions, with three big fans mounted on a massive heatsink.


          The design is quite modest until you come to the RGB light strip along the upper portion of the cooler, as well as a lit logo on the backboard. A pair of conventional 8-pin PCIe connections supply power, while display outputs include three DisplayPort and one HDMI.


          SAPPHIRE's NITRO+ Radeon RX 6800 is factory overclocked and is housed in a triple-fan, 2.7-slot configuration. The card has some OC headroom for manual OC tuning, which I've documented in this review. 


          You may see some side-by-side comparisons of the SAPPHIRE NITRO+ Radeon RX 6800 at stock and with the card's highest overclock.


          The Ray Accelerator, a high-performance ray-tracing acceleration system, is one of the most significant new additions to the new RDNA 2 architecture. AMD doesn't have NVIDIA-level ray tracing performance, but RDNA 2 does.


          Sapphire's NITRO+ version of AMD's Radeon RX 6800 delivers excellent performance, ARGB-infused aesthetics, and minimal noise right out of the box.


          The efficient cooling architecture allows for somewhat lower thermals than we saw with AMD's standard design with a conservative default profile, and some fast fan curve tuning can result in even lower temperatures under load.

      Yes, the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X is an outstanding gaming processor, if a bit expensive. Its 12 cores may be a little excessive for games, but its raw processing power puts it head and shoulders above competitors.

      The Ryzen 9 5900X is ideal for compilation, developers, virtual machines, hosting, and so on! It's a great chip, but if you don't use it for its full potential to employ its cores and multitasking capability at high clock rates, it will become overkill.
