      The best GPU you can afford is what you should strive for. It's always
      preferable to spend as much money as you can now rather than having to
      spend more money afterward. Which GPU you should use is also heavily
      influenced by the sort of display you're using.


      The CPU's design has 12 cores, making it suitable for both current and future gaming titles. Additionally, the 5900X might be a good foundation for an entry-level workstation PC focusing on simulation, video, or image processing. In any case, we're looking at a configuration that doesn't need a lot of money and can provide either top-tier graphics performance or massive productivity capabilities.

  In 2021, we examined the best GPU for Ryzen 9 5900x setups. The centerpiece of
  a gaming PC is that the graphics card and the processor are essential parts of
  a system. Of course, the RAM and motherboard are equally crucial. But if there
  is one component that should be prioritized, it is the GPU.


  In conclusion, we believe that these are the finest graphics cards for Ryzen 9 5900X, with smooth visuals and stunning graphics. We have included the graphics cards that we feel give the highest performance based on different analyses and comparisons

  There are several variables to consider when selecting the best video card for
  you. Dimensions, resolution, clock speed.


  If you're just getting started and these words aren't completely obvious to you, here are some explanations and pointers to keep in mind while choosing the ideal graphics card for your requirements. It should be noted that it is strongly advised to invest in the mid/high range for stream gaming.


  ### Screen resolution


  An essential consideration for a PC gamer is what resolution the video card is best suited for. Yes, the higher the number of graphic pixels on a screen, the more power it will demand from its GPU. 


  If you have a 1080p screen, designing a PC needs a delicate balance to avoid bottlenecks and power outages.


  Even low-end GPUs can now display some games at 3,840 x 2,160 pixels (or more simply in 4K). 


  However, certain games in beta or demanding a lot of power (PUBG) will be poorly handled by a low-end graphics card. In particular, the video card calculates the locations, geometry, and lighting and restoring the image to the screen in real-time.


  Higher resolution and accuracy will necessitate more processing power from the graphics card.


  Of course, depending on your video card, it will be feasible or even suggested to lower the degree of detail in the visuals to get better performance and a good number of FPS. 


  It is worth noting that today's most advanced graphics cards are designed for 4K resolution and occasionally deliver extremely high Frame Rates.


  ### Graphics engine clock frequency/speed


  The clock speed refers to the rate at which the CPU executes graphics requests given by the processor. By limiting yourself to graphics cards from the same family, the number of Mhz will correlate to the speed of your video card. 


  Be aware that just because a graphics card has the highest clock speed on the market does not guarantee it is the quickest. No way, because everything is dependent on the quality of its architecture. Higher-frequency video cards can occasionally be slower. So, don't be afraid to educate yourself and look at tests and comparators.


  The boost clock is the pace at which the graphics processor may momentarily accelerate when a large load arrives unexpectedly. It's similar to Turbo Boost for CPUs. Of course, it will only work as long as the temperature circumstances permit!


  ### The video memory of the graphics card


  You should be aware that the video card's RAM can hold all of the fundamental graphical data of a video game. Because it is directly built into the graphics card, it provides ultra-fast data access and enables improved gaming performance. There is no need to access the PC's total RAM!


  As a result, video memory provides considerably quicker bandwidth, which is undoubtedly impressive and necessary for video games. 


  So, don't be confused: the speed of the bandwidth, not the number of GB of RAM accessible on the graphics card, essentially enhances the graphics card's performance. However, to make the most of this incredible bandwidth, we will want a room!


  Indeed, depending on the appetite of your game and the resolution of your screen, a few Giga will be required to experience maximum performance across the board. 


  This allows your graphics card to retrieve all of the graphical data required to execute the game at its highest settings. 


  It is worth noting that currently, a card designed for 1920 x 1080 pixel (1080p) games would often contain 4 GB or 6 GB of RAM. Cards for playing on 2560 x 1440 (1440p) or 3840 x 2160 (2160p or 4K) screens will often have 8 GB or more.


  ### Freesync and G-sync graphics cards


  AMD's Freesync and Nvidia's G-sync are examples of "adaptive sync" technology. The screen will display a refresh rate that will adjust based on the graphics card's output capabilities. 


  Without this technique, the frame rate might cause various artifacts, shifts, or even jerks on the visual level. 


  Essentially, these technologies let the monitor display the image only when the graphics card has given all of the resources required to display it in its entirety.


  If your best gaming monitor supports any of these two technologies, it can only be a significant plus in terms of the graphical quality of its video games. But be careful: you must use a graphics card that supports the same technology as the screen, either G-sync or Freesync.


  Each graphics card will consume a different amount of power. This might be a factor to consider if you have a limited budget.

          Nvidia's Nvidia's new RTX 3060 Ti is an unexpected entry to the company's range of RTX 3000 Line-up. It will provide greater performance than the prior, and the RTX 3060 Ti will be capable of 4K gaming if you're prepared to lower the settings.


          The card's size and form are similar to an RTX 3070 coupled with a conventional dual-fan configuration. The two fans operate in tandem to keep the card cool.


          In addition, the 3060 Ti has a single HDMI connector and three Display ports. Nvidia has removed the USB-C port present in the RTX 2000 series. The power needs for Nvidia's RTX 3000 series cards have all been increased, although the RTX 3060 Ti is milder. Nvidia recommends a 600W power supply for the RTX 3060 Ti, consuming up to 200 watts.


          DLSS has constantly impressed us throughout our testing of the RTX 3060 Ti. You can choose between quality and reliability modes for DLSS in a broad range of games. Nvidia's image analysis technology will effectively make the game at a lower resolution and then upscale the image to make it look realistic.


          If you want to create an affordable 2k gaming PC, the RTX 3060 Ti is a must-have. It offers great 2k performance, support for ray tracing, Nvidia's DLSS innovation, and a variety of RTX features aimed at professionals.
